- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JosueCuevas
- ðŸ‘€ In a traditional way Iâ€™m a student of Renewable Energy Engineering but as a self-taught person I really enjoy to learn new things 
- ðŸŒ± I already know JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Basic SQL. Now Iâ€™m trying to make some projects in my city and maybe to get a job as programmer in the future
